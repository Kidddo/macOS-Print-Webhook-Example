##Kidddo macOS Print Webhook Example (Node.js)

This is an example of how to utilize Kidddo's [Print Webhook](https://kidddo.com/print-webhook) feature to create your own Print Server on macOS. This guide is intended for experienced developers - attempt at your own risk. At the time of this writing the latest version of Node.js and referenced modules work - but you will want to verify and make modifications as necessary.

Your device must be accessible on the internet. If you don't know how to set this up in your router, consider using a Tunneling service such as [localhost.run](https://localhost.run).

Here's our checklist of what we will accomplish:

* Install Printer Drivers
* Turn on the Mac's web interface for its CUPS server
* Add Printer(s) to CUPS admin page
* Install Node.js and required Modules
* Configure PrintServer.js
* Run PrintServer.js
* Run without Terminal
* Auto-Run at System Startup

===
###Install Printer Drivers
For the purpose of this tutorial we will be installing a DYMO Labelwriter printer. (If you're using a different printer - you should be able to find driver downloads on their manufacture's website)

Download Printer Drivers from [DYMO](https://www.dymo.com/compatibility-chart.html)

Install downloaded package using it's installer.

===
###Turn on the Mac's web interface for it's CUPS server

Your CUPS server resides at [http://127.0.0.1:631](http://127.0.0.1:631). Visit that link in your browser - if the Web Interface does not appear - you will need to enable it:

Open Terminal (this application is found in the Applications/Utilities folder)

Type or paste the following command into your Terminal prompt and hit return:

    sudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes

Now the Web Interface should appear when you refresh your browser page.

===
###Add Printer(s) to CUPS admin page
In the Web Interface, click on the [Administrative](http://127.0.0.1:631/admin) tab and then click on "Add Printer". Select your connected label printer from the "Local Printers" list and click "Continue".

The Description is what will be referred to as your printer "name" in your Kidddo account. Name it something easily identifiable such as "dymo1". Add a location if you'd like (not necessary) and click "Continue".

Select the correct Driver for your printer model and click "Continue".

You should now be able to access your printer settings through: [http://127.0.0.1:631/printers/dymo1](http://127.0.0.1:631/printers/dymo1) (subsitute "dymo1" for your printer name).

If you'd like you can print a test page by selecting "Print Test Page" from the "Maintenance" drop down to make sure everything is working correctly so far.

===
###Install Node.js
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Our print server will run on this platform.

Download and install the free package from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

A Node.js module manager called NPM will be installed automatically and this is what we will use to install the required modules for our server.

Open Terminal back up and type or paste the following command and hit return:

    npm install express ipp pdfkit

This will install the following modules:

* [express](https://npmjs.org/package/ibtrealtimesjnode) (router for receiving the JSON payload)
* [ipp](https://npmjs.org/package/ipp) (for printing to our CUPS server)
* [pdfkit](https://npmjs.org/package/pdfkit) (for generating labels)

The install process may take a few moments. If there are any errors you will want to repeat the process.

===
###Configure wh.js

Open wh.js in "Text Edit" your favorite plain-text editor.

We're going to focus on 1 line near the top of the script: 

    const port = 3000;

If port 3000 is already in use on your device, feel free to change this to whatever you'd like. Just remember to add the port (if other than 80) in your Webhook URL in your Kidddo [Settings](https://kidddo.com/admin#settings) > Set Printer > Webhook:

	https://myurl.localhost.run:3000/webhook


===
###Run wh.js

In Terminal type `node` followed by a space and the path to where wh.js is saved and hit return:

    node wh.js

**TIP:** Terminal will auto-fill the path at the cursor if you drop the file on it's window.

===
###Run without Terminal

Now that we're up and running, say you'd like to be able to Run or Auto-Run wh.js without having to open Terminal or use the command-line every time...

We can use another built-in tool in macOS called [Automator](http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/) to create an app that will run a shell script for us.

#####Make wh.js Executable

In Terminal, type (substituing "wh.js" with the full path to your copy of wh.js):

    chmod +x wh.js

#####Automator

Open Automator (in your Applications folder) create a new document (File->New) and select "Application" as the document type.

In the search field, search for the action, "Run Shell Script" and drag it to the drop zone on the workflow area (right-side). The "Run Shell Script Action" should appear with `Shell: /bin/bash` and `Pass input: to stdin` - if not, change them to be so.

In the action window, type or paste the following:

    PATH=$PATH:~/:/usr/local/bin wh.js

If PrintServer.js is not in `usr/local/bin` (the home folder of your user acccount) then substitute the appropriate directory.

Save your new application (File->Save), choose a location and name for the app (eg. PrintServer Launcher) and hit "Save". Now you can double-click the app icon to run wh.js like you would any other app. A spinning gear should display in your menu bar - where you can also stop the script from running.

===
###Auto-Run at System Startup

Now that you've come this far, why not have your PrintServer automatically run when OS X starts up? In case you don't already know how to set this up:

Open System Preferences.

Click Users/Groups.

Select a User and Click the "Login Items" tab.

Click the "+" to add a new app.

Navigate to your PrintServer Launcher app and click "Add".
